****Temperature Sensor Calibration and Error Analysis****



**Project overview**

This project involves developing a C++ program to simulate temperature sensor data and apply calibration techniques. The main goals are to simulate sensor readings, calibrate the sensor data using linear and polynomial methods, and analyze the calibration errors.

**Features**

Simulated Sensor Data: Generates synthetic temperature readings to mimic real-world sensor data.

Calibration Methods: Implements both linear and polynomial calibration techniques to correct sensor data.

Error Analysis: Computes and analyzes calibration errors to evaluate the accuracy of the calibration methods.

**Getting Started**


**Prerequisites**

C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)

matplotlib Libraries for visualization (if needed for further analysis)

****How to Run the Program**

**Clone the Repository:****


git clone [GitHub Repository URL]
cd [Repository Directory]

Compile the Code:

g++ -o temperature_calibration temperature_calibration.cpp


Run the Program:

./temperature_calibration
